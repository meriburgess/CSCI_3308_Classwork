AWK and SED

AWK
text patter scanning and processing lang.
operates on each line of an input file
begin { init. awk commands}
{ commands for each line of file }
END { finalization awk commands } 

each line is a number of fields, separated by fied separator 
default : 1 or more space character
first field is $1, then $2, and so on. Whole line is $0 
NR - current record number (line number of input file)
NF - number of fields in current line

ls -l | awk '{print $5}' 
prints 5th column of ls-l (file size col)

ls -l | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0} {sum = sum+$5} END {print sum}'
prints sum of all file sizes in directory 

ls -l | awk '/^d/' 
prints all directories only 

SED
performs basic text transformations on an input stream 

sed 's/input/output' my_file 
sed 's/input/output/g' my_file  -- change all occurrences 

search and replace 
default: output is written to stdout. 

sed 's/input/output' myfile > newfile --- redirect to new file 
sed -i 's/input/output' myfile --- file itself gets updated

& represents anything you are trying to match
sed 's/[0-9]*/(&)/' myfile  ---- any number 0 thru 9, 

sed 's/abc/def/' my_file -- replaces 'abc' with 'def'

sed '/pattern/command' myfile 
'pattern' is regexp and command can be one of s= search & replace or p, d, i, a 
print delete insert append

ls -l | sed -n '/^d/ p'
print all directories only

sed '/^#d' myfile 
delete all lines that start with comment symbol

delete first 100 lines in file
sed '1,100 d' myfile 
sed '1, $ d' myfile --- delete all lines
